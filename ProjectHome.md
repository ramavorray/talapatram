# Talapatram - Latest Release Version 2.1 #
## Indian Languages Editing and Keyboard Layout Software ##
### Free to Use and Open Source ###

**_Talapatram_** is an Indian Languages editing software with a provision to **type in 11 of the Indian languages** (+ English) with on-screen dynamic keyboard layouts.

It is like a virtual keyboard which overlays a virtual layout on your current English keyboard and lets you type in **Bengali**, **English**, **Farsi**, **Gujarati**, **Hindi**, **Kannada**, **Malayalam**, **Marathi**, **Punjabi**, **Tamil**, **Telugu** and **Urdu** OR in any combination of the above 12 languages.

Keyboard layouts that it uses are standard keyboard layouts specified by the ISO. Text typed can be saved as simple text files with UTF-8 encoding which can be ported to any platform and can be copied to and used in any other application (e.g., MS Word).

It is not a transliterator. It is a desktop application which lets you type directly in any combination of the above said 11 languages as people used to do using type-writing machines in olden days. Keyboard layouts in Talapatram are similar to the ones that used to be present on old type-writing machines, which are standard (like english keyboard). So, normal keyboard skills are sufficient to get used to the tool.
